I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.

Reflection (1-2 paragraphs): I quite enjoyed putting this together. I think I used a bit more css than I was supposed to really. I did a lot of looking up how to do things. I made a lot of use of classes in css, though my css file is probably a bit of a dumpster fire with it's formating. I also should have avoided assigning attributes to elements directly rather than using classes and divs as it'll make it likely to apply in places I don't want them to apply.

      <p>The image on the right is a picture of myself awkwardly smiling. The purpose of this paragraph is entirely to
        show that the text is capable of wrapping around the image. Because the image is formated with float in the css
        file, therefore this text wrapps itself around the image instead of overlapping or being place before or after
        the image. This however won't be immediately obvious unless the webpage is skinny enough to push the text below
        the image.</p>
      <p>This second paragraph is here to both add more text and to show the spacing between paragraphs. As you should 
        be able to see, this paragraph also starts with a indent on the first line. I have to add plenty of text to
        make this obvious. I ran into an issue with the indent for a decent amount of time but in the end I eventually 
        figured it out. It used to have a percentile amount but I later changed it to pixels. Because I may not come
        back to edit this, it might be changed back or changed to be based on the text size.</p>

    <h2>My personal interests:</h2>
    <div class="left-aligned-text">
      <p>The first interest I would like to talk about is my interest in drawing. I love to draw in a digital format on
        my drawing tablet. I'm always aspiring to improve my drawing capabilities. However, I do often find myself going
        long periods without drawing due to being too busy or uninspired. It's something I wish to work on.</p>
      <img src="Runeknight Collector  White-portrait.png" height="500" width="500" alt="Collector Image"
        class="right-aligned-image">
      <p>The second interest I would love to talk about is Dungeons and Dragons. I enjoy playing the table top role
        playing game known as dungeons and dragons and play mostly with the 5th edition rules. I have played D&D for
        years now, being introduced early in junior high. Currently I am in four different groups, three of which are
        with the same DM in an online format and the fourth with a bunch of my highschool friends. One of my favorite
        character concepts that I've used many times is a character known as "The Collector" who is actually someone
        cursed by an ancient magic that strips them of their personal identity to force them to continue the legacy of
        an ancient being known only as "The Collector"</p>

      <p>Finally, my third interest, which is largely related to my first interest actually, is in the pokemon Mewtwo.
        Specificly Mewtwo. I'm otherwise not much of a fan of pokemon. I like to draw Mewtwos and have designed several
        origional characters based on Mewtwo. Two of which can be seen in the background image on the website. That
        image was commisioned from my favorite artist, <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/tc-96">TC-96</a>, who serves
        as a large inspiration for many of my own drawings. </p>
